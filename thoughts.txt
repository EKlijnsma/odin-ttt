Build a tic-tac-toe game on the command line where two human players 
can play against each other and the board is displayed in between turns.

Think about how you would set up the different elements within the gameâ€¦ 
What should be a class? 
Instance variable? 
Method? 
A few minutes of thought can save you from wasting an hour of coding.
Build your game, taking care to not share information between classes any more than you have to.
Post your solution below, then check out this example solution from RosettaCode.org.

Player class
    A player has a name/symbol and a player can make moves
    Maybe a player also has a total score tally and can win/lose 

Board class
    A board has cells (3x3)
    A board has a state (the current configuration)
    A board can take moves (and update its state)

Game class
    A game has a board
    A game has 2 players
    A game has a state (running, game-over)
    A game can announce who is next
    A game can render its board
    A game can process a move (and update its state accordingly)

Game logic:
    Start game
    Pick random player
    LOOP
        Render board
        Get move
        Process move
        If gameover (game won or no more moves)
            break
        else 
            switch players
    Announce result
